## Course Description

This class is about figuring out together what cities and users can do to reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. Many other classes at MIT focus on policies, technologies, and systems, often at the national or international level, but this course focuses on the scale of cities and users for the following reasons:

- Cities are centers of economic activity, population, and energy and material consumption.
- Cities, not nations, are making the most ambitious commitments towards climate goals.
- This scale reveals inequality, racism, and environmental justice issues in the energy system.
- The relationship of users to the energy system has been static for nearly a century.
- New information and data technologies are rapidly changing the built environment.
- Developing countries could leapfrog existing technologies, and many developed countries need to replace existing systems. 

This course is designed for any students interested in learning how to intervene in the energy use of cities using policy, technology, economics, and urban planning. I welcome students with many different backgrounds because it enriches our discussions, but some of the following rationales for this course may also appeal to you:  

- For planners, there are many jobs in this area that will shape how we use energy in the future. This class will integrate fundamental technical understanding with your policy skills so you can tackle the inevitable energy and climate issues that will affect all communities in the future.  
- For engineers, 54% of all people now live in cities that generate 70% of world carbon emissions and 80% of world GDP; by 2050, 66% of the world's population is expected to be urban. The focus of this class on urban energy use, efficiency, jurisdiction, institutions, and governance complements many other more technical classes at MIT.
- For climate change: given the uncertain prospects of national and international efforts, efforts in cities may be the fastest and most pragmatic solution.

## Expectations in COVID  

For everyone, and most definitely in order of importance:  

1. Stay healthy (e.g. sleep, eat, practice self-care, esp. mental!)  
2. Keep each other healthy (e.g. wear masks, practice pre-emptive isolation)  
3. Participate (Come to class, office hours; ask questions, engage on Slack! ) 
4. Communicate (Talk about how things are going with me or others!)  
5. Stay flexible (Everybody continue to do their best!)  

Any ideas or suggestions that you have to improve your and our experience are welcome!

## Learning objectives 

- Learn about the role and potential of cities and users to shape the energy system
- Develop understanding of energy systems, infrastructure, and technology in cities
- Figure out how to achieve an equitable energy transition
- Develop ability to do simple back-of-the-envelope calculations
- Identify key points or issues for future management, intervention, or revolution
- Work together with a diverse group of people and disciplines
- Develop a highly-detailed understanding for a group of cities together as a class

## Structure of the Course

This class is divided into two halves. In the first segment you are learning which basic calculations to perform in order to analyze one or two cities (more on that later), and we will learn about key technical aspects of energy systems in all cities. In the second segment we will examine the policies and institutions governing urban energy systems, with a particular focus on regulation and markets of the electricity sector in the US. Putting the two halves together will help you decide where and how to intervene in urban energy systems.  

## Activities 

In the beginning of class, we will build a composite picture of our class, using our personal experiences and visions for the future to energy systems that you are familiar with. Please calculate the current carbon emissions for yourself and/or an average resident for where (a) you lived before MIT and (b) where and how you think you will live in 2050, using the CoolClimate calculator. In the first half of the semester, before each class, doing the reading and a basic calculation exercise will help build up your understanding of what numbers matter, as well as your background knowledge of a particular city. We will reinforce the knowledge with an exam, but if you do the calculation/homework each week, I expect that the exam should be fairly straightforward. In the second half of the semester, before each class, researching, writing up a few notes, submitting questions, and getting feedback will help you build up the base of knowledge and material that you need to write your paper. We will have group discussions in the last three classes to share knowledge from our papers. This is also a good chance to put finishing touches on your final paper. Writing a good paper is much easier if you plan ahead, get feedback or help from your classmates, the MIT Writing and Communication Center, and myself, and have time to revise.

The final paper assignment will synthesize what you lean over the semester by considering the prospects for a technological or policy innovation in a city of your choosing (I recommend your home or future city). Undergraduates will be expected to write a short paper of 5 pages minimum. Graduate students will write a paper of 10 pages minimum, with the additional task of analyzing their chosen city in terms of its expected future demographic changes. See the paper writing guidelines below.  

## Readings

There are two books for the class. The first is required and the second is optional: 

- Required (free): MacKay, David J.C., 2009. *Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air*, 1st ed.. UIT Cambridge Ltd. ISBN: 9780954452933. Available in paperback from your local or global bookseller for $27-50, and/or can be downloaded legally as a PDF or read in webpage format at [withouthotair.com](withouthotair.com). 
- Optional: Hawken, Paul, ed. 2017. *Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming.* Penguin. ISBN: 9780143130444.

Other papers assigned for each class and which will be available on the class folder on the cloud. I may occasionally modify the weekly readings and will notify you in advance.

I will start most classroom days with a brief discussion about current events related to our reading, and this news service provides terrific updates that will keep you updated on energy, climate, as well as related policies and legislation. You can also sign up in advance for two news services:  

- [E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/)
- [Energy News Network](https://energynews.us/) (U.S. and regional energy news)

Other excellent climate newsletters are put out by the *New York Times* (Climate Forward), the *New Yorker,* the *Atlantic,* the *Wall Street Journal,* the *Washington Post,* *Time,* etc. It is all too much to read every day, but a valuable way to see what energy and climate people are talking about.

**Schedule & topics**    
All readings can be found in the bibliography, class Google drive, and/or on the web. Readings are denoted by (links), with a dash to indicate chapter numbers and/or appendix letters. For example,     
\`\[1\]-2,3' indicates reading 1, chapters 2 and 3; s = skim; psets = problem sets; rq = send reading     
questions in for discussion on Slack.

## Grading  

### Expectations / norms   

- Do reading and submit your problem sets or questions the evening before class
- Ask questions and contribute insights for everyone's learning
- Focus on class discussion and lecture
- Use technology effectively and only as needed   

### Breakdown   

The details marked TBD (to be determined) will depend on the number of students in the class and number of topics that we want to cover.   

- Before class prep: problem sets and reading questions 25%   
- Class presence / discussion / participation 10%   
- Exam 25%   
- Paper proposal 5%   
- Short presentation, group discussion 5%   
- Final paper 30%   

Please make an effort to be on time for class, and please let me know in advance if you will miss class. Missing more than two classes will affect your participation/discussion grade.   

## Assignments and due dates   

Problem sets and reading questions are due by midnight (11:59 pm) the day before class. Earlier is better for your sleep, though!   

- The exam will follow a similar format as the problem sets. I may also give some additional practice problems.   
- Paper proposal: one-page single-spaced proposal maximum for your final paper (see below).  The topic is not binding, but I want you to think about the topic and area early so you can look out for, and suggest to each other, material for your papers.
- Short presentation: schedule TBD based on student interests (and numbers). One slide maximum, 16 point font minimum, must be circulated to your classmates and me in PDF format one full day beforehand. 
- Final paper: this will describe a strategic plan to meet one specific energy challenge for a specific city. This paper will include a description of your plan and/or intervention, with an assessment of its prospects for success (strengths, weaknesses, other contributing factors necessary), an assessment of the capability of proposed or existing institutions to carry out the plan, and an analysis of its likely environmental, economic, and social effects. You should also turn in basic calculations as needed (not included in the paper page limit), which shows how you derived the key calculations that are the foundation of your paper analysis. Due two days after last class, December 11. 

### Paper criteria  

In general, papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which they present a clear and coherent argument, introduce appropriate supporting evidence, and develop the argument to a logical conclusion. You should develop your writing and thoughts through multiple written drafts. Other considerations:   

- Format: Avoid overly fancy graphic layouts for your paper. Please use black text, white paper, 1.5 or double-spacing, a font with serifs, minimum font size 11. 
- Bibliographies: You should include a full bibliography in a common citation format (for example, University of Chicago, Harvard, MLA). This will not count towards the total pages of the paper. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a great free tool that can help you organize your citations, materials, and writing process.
- Tables & graphics: You are encouraged to use any tools that you need to communicate, such as maps, figures, or tables, but these exhibits may not exceed 20% of the pages.
- Captions and references help to integrate graphics and text. These exhibits will also be graded for clarity, cogency, and the degree to which they support, inform, or extend the argument presented in the text. 

The MIT Writing and Communication Center (WCC) offers free one-on-one professional advice from communication experts with advanced degrees and publishing experience. The WCC can help you further develop your oral communication skills and learn about all types of academic and professional writing. You can learn more about the WCC consultations at [http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center) and register with the online scheduler to make appointments through [https://mit.mywconline.com](https://mit.mywconline.com). Please note that the WCC hours are offered on Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m., and fill up fast.

### Extensions   

Each person is allowed to miss up to 3 problem sets and reading questions, which are assessed automatically. if you miss the midnight deadline. I can't give any extensions for the final paper because grades are due three days after the end of class, so plan ahead for this. In cases of extreme physical or emotional circumstances, any further extensions should be requested from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education ([http://odge.mit.edu);](http://odge.mit.edu);) if they decide that an extension is warranted, they will then send me a generic note, which preserves your privacy.

## ADA Accommodations 

Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet course requirements should contact me as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements with MIT's Student Disabilities Services: [http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html](http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html).   

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, and facilitating academic dishonesty are academic crimes. It is your responsibility as students and scholars to understand the definition of any such activities, and to avoid and discourage them. Engaging in these activities either knowingly or unknowingly may result in severe academic sanctions, and you are therefore expected to familiarize yourself with MIT's policies: [https://integrity.mit.edu](https://integrity.mit.edu).
