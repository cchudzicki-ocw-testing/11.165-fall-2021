**2.1 Learning objectives**   
â€¢ Learn about the role and potential of cities and users to shape the energy system,Â   
â€¢ Develop understanding of energy systems, infrastructure, and technology in cities,Â   
â€¢ Figure out how to achieve an equitable energy transition,Â   
â€¢ Develop ability to do simple back-of-the-envelope calculations,Â   
â€¢ Identify key points or issues for future management, intervention, or revolution,Â   
â€¢ Work together with a diverse group of people and disciplines, andÂ   
â€¢ Develop a highly-detailed understanding for a group of cities together as a class.Â   
**2.2 Introduction**   
This class is about Â guring out together what cities and users can do to reduce their energy use andÂ   
carbon emissions. Many other classes at MIT focus on policies, technologies, and systems, often atÂ   
the national or international level, but this course focuses on the scale of cities and users because:Â   
â€¢ cities are centers of economic activity, population, and energy and material consumptionÂ   
â€¢ cities, not nations, are making the most ambitious commitments towards climate goals,Â   
â€¢ this scale reveals inequality, racism, and environmental justice issues in the energy system,Â   
â€¢ the relationship of users to the energy system has been static for nearly a century,Â   
â€¢ new information and data technologies are rapidly changing the built environment,Â   
â€¢ developing countries could leapfrog existing technologies, and many developed countries needÂ   
to replace existing systems.Â   
This course is designed for any students interested in learning how to intervene in the energy useÂ   
of cities using policy, technology, economics, and urban planning. I welcome students with manyÂ   
dierent backgrounds because it enriches our discussions, but some of the following rationales forÂ   
this course may also appeal to you:Â   
â€¢ For planners, there are many jobs in this area that will shape how we use energy in the future.Â   
This class will integrate fundamental technical understanding with your policy skills so youÂ   
can tackle the inevitable energy and climate issues that will aect all communities in theÂ   
future.Â   
â€¢ For engineers, 54% of all people now live in cities that generate 70% of world carbon emissionsÂ   
and 80% of world GDP; by 2050, 66% of the world's population is expected to be urban. TheÂ   
focus of this class on urban energy use, eciency, jurisdiction, institutions, and governanceÂ   
complements many other more technical classes at MIT.Â   
â€¢ For climate change: given the uncertain prospects of national and international eorts, eortsÂ   
in cities may be the fastest and most pragmatic solution.Â   
**2.3 Structure**   
This class is divided into two halves:Â   
â€¢ in the Â rst segment (September 9 to November 2) you are learning which basic calculationsÂ   
to perform in order to analyze one or two cities (more on that later), and we will learn aboutÂ   
key technical aspects of energy systems in all cities.Â   
2Â   
â€¢ in the second segment (November 4 to December 9), we will examine the policies and institutionsÂ   
governing urban energy systems, with a particular focus on regulation and marketsÂ   
of the electricity sector in the US.Â   
Putting the two halves together will help you decide where and how to intervene in urban energyÂ   
systems.Â   
**2.4 Activities**   
In the beginning of class, we will build a composite picture of our class, using our personal experiencesÂ   
and visions for the future to energy systems that you are familiar with. Please calculateÂ   
the current carbon emissions for yourself and/or an average resident for where (a) you lived beforeÂ   
MIT and (b) where and how you think you will live in 2050, using the CoolClimate calculator.Â   
In the Â rst half of the semester, before each class, doing the reading and a basic calculationÂ   
exercise will help build up your understanding of what numbers matter, as well as your backgroundÂ   
knowledge of a particular city. We will reinforce the knowledge with an exam, but if you do theÂ   
calculation/homework each week, I expect that the exam should be fairly straightforward.Â   
In the second half of the semester, before each class, researching, writing up a few notes,Â   
submitting questions, and getting feedback will help you build up the base of knowledge andÂ   
material that you need to write your paper. We will have group discussions in the last three classesÂ   
to share knowledge from our papers. This is also a good chance to put Â nishing touches on yourÂ   
nal paper. Writing a good paper is much easier if you plan ahead, get feedback or help from yourÂ   
classmates, the MIT Writing and Communication Center, and myself, and have time to revise.Â   
The Â nal paper assignment will synthesize what you lean over the semester by considering theÂ   
prospects for a technological or policy innovation in a city of your choosing (I recommend yourÂ   
home or future city). Undergraduates will be expected to write a short paper of 5 pages minimum.Â   
Graduate students will write a paper of 10 pages minimum, with the additional task of analyzingÂ   
their chosen city in terms of its expected future demographic changes. See the paper writingÂ   
guidelines below.Â   
**2.5 Readings**   
There are two books for the class. The Â rst is required and the second is optional:Â   
1\. Required (free): MacKay, D.J., 2009. Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air, 1st ed.,Â   
UIT Cambridge Ltd. Available in paperback from your local or global bookseller for $27-50,Â   
and/or can be downloaded legally as a PDF or read in webpage format at withouthotair.com.Â   
The cheapest way to get a hardcopy is to print it out at CRON and have it bound at MITÂ   
Copytech.Â   
2\. Optional: Hawken, Paul, ed. 2017. Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever ProposedÂ   
to Reverse Global Warming Penguin. Can be purchased at local bookstores or Amazon.Â   
Other papers assigned for each class and which will be available on the class folder on the cloud. IÂ   
may occasionally modify the weekly readings and will notify you in advance.Â   
I will start most classroom days with a brief discussion about current events related to ourÂ   
reading, and this news service provides terric updates that will keep you updated on energy,Â   
climate, as well as related policies and legislation. You can also signup in advance for two newsÂ   
services:Â   
â€¢ E&E News, an excellent news service that you get free access to through the MIT LibrariesÂ   
here; select \\Join my organization's account".Â   
3Â   
â€¢ U.S. and regional Energy News Networks, available here. These newsletters are an excellentÂ   
source of local and regional energy news.Â   
Other excellent climate newsletters are put out by the New York Times (Climate Fwd:); the NewÂ   
Yorker; the Atlantic; the Wall Street Journal; the Washington Post; Time; etc. It is all too muchÂ   
to read everyday but a valuable way to see what energy and climate people are talking about.Â   
**2.6 Schedule & topics**   
All readings can be found in the bibliography, class Google drive, and/or on the web. Readings areÂ   
denoted by (links), with a dash to indicate chapter numbers and/or appendix letters. For example,Â   
\`\[1\]-2,3' indicates reading 1, chapters 2 and 3; s = skim; psets = problem sets; rq = send readingÂ   
questions in for discussion on Slack.Â

TOTAL = 100%Â   
Please make an eort to be on time for class, and please let me know in advance if you will missÂ   
class. Missing more than two classes will aect your participation / discussion grade.Â   
2.7.3 Assignments and due datesÂ   
â€¢ Problem sets and reading questions are due by midnight (11:59 pm) the day before class.Â   
Earlier is better for your sleep, though.Â   
â€¢ Exam will follow a similar format as the problem sets. I may also give some additional practiceÂ   
problems.Â   
â€¢ Paper proposal: one-page single-spaced proposal maximum for your Â nal paper (see below).Â   
The topic is not binding, but I want you to think about the topic and area early so you canÂ   
look out for, and suggest to each other, material for your papers.Â   
â€¢ Short presentation: schedule TBD based on student interests (and numbers). One slideÂ   
maximum, 16 point font minimum, must be circulated to your classmates and me in PDFÂ   
format one full day beforehand.Â   
â€¢ Final paper: this will describe a strategic plan to meet one specic energy challenge for aÂ   
specic city. This paper will include a description of your plan and/or intervention, withÂ   
an assessment of its prospects for success (strengths, weaknesses, other contributing factorsÂ   
necessary), an assessment of the capability of proposed or existing institutions to carry outÂ   
the plan, and an analysis of its likely environmental, economic, and social eects. You shouldÂ   
also turn in basic calculations as needed (not included in the paper page limit), which showsÂ   
how you derived the key calculations that are the foundation of your paper analysis. Due twoÂ   
days after last class, December 11.Â   
5Â   
**2.7.4 Paper criteria**   
In general, papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which they present a clear and coherentÂ   
argument, introduce appropriate supporting evidence, and develop the argument to a logicalÂ   
conclusion. You should develop your writing and thoughts through multiple written drafts. OtherÂ   
considerations:Â   
â€¢ Format: Avoid overly fancy graphic layouts for your paper. Please use black text, whiteÂ   
paper, 1.5 or double-spacing, a font with serifs, minimum font size 11.Â   
â€¢ Bibliographies: You should include a full bibliography in a common citation format (forÂ   
example, University of Chicago, Harvard, MLA). This will not count towards the total pagesÂ   
of the paper. Zotero is a great free tool that can help you organize your citations, materials,Â   
and writing process.Â   
â€¢ Tables & graphics: You are encouraged to use any tools that you need to communicate, suchÂ   
as maps, Â gures, or tables, but these exhibits may not exceed 20% of the pages. Captions andÂ   
references help to integrate graphics and text. These exhibits will also be graded for clarity,Â   
cogency, and the degree to which they support, inform, or extend the argument presented inÂ   
the text.Â   
â€¢ The MIT Writing and Communication Center (WCC) oers free one-on-one professional adviceÂ   
from communication experts with advanced degrees and publishing experience. TheÂ   
WCC can help you further develop your oral communication skills and learn about all typesÂ   
of academic and professional writing. You can learn more about the WCC consultations atÂ   
[http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center) and register with the online schedulerÂ   
to make appointments through [https://mit.mywconline.com](https://mit.mywconline.com). Please note that the WCCÂ   
hours are oered on Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m., and Â ll up fast.Â   
2.7.5 ExtensionsÂ   
Each person is allowed to miss up to 3 psets and reading questions, which are assessed automaticallyÂ   
if you miss the midnight deadline. I can't give any extensions for the Â nal paper because gradesÂ   
are due three days after the end of class, so plan ahead for this. In cases of extreme physical orÂ   
emotional circumstances, any further extensions should be requested from the Oce of the Dean ofÂ   
Graduate Education ([http://odge.mit.edu);](http://odge.mit.edu);) if they decide that an extension is warranted, theyÂ   
will then send me a generic note, which preserves your privacy.Â   
2.7.6 ADA accommodationsÂ   
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet courseÂ   
requirements should contact me as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements with MIT'sÂ   
Student Disabilities Services: [http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html](http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html).Â   
2.7.7 Academic integrityÂ   
Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, and facilitating academic dishonesty are academicÂ   
crimes. It is your responsibility as students and scholars to understand the denition of any suchÂ   
activities, and to avoid and discourage them. Engaging in these activities either knowingly orÂ   
unknowingly may result in severe academic sanctions, and you are therefore expected to familiarizeÂ   
yourself with MIT's policies: [https://integrity.mit.edu](https://integrity.mit.edu).Â

3 **DUSP policies & resources**   
3.1 COVID contingency plansÂ   
MIT and DUSP are excited at the opportunity for a return to in-person teaching and learning afterÂ   
2+ semesters of remote life. To ensure that all classes can and will be delivered in person, MITÂ   
has worked hard to put into place policies, procedures and technologies to maximize the likelihoodÂ   
of a safe and uninterrupted semester. That said, the ever-evolving pandemic means we need toÂ   
be prepared. If any student in class tests positive for covid-19, MIT Medical has established clearÂ   
procedures for ensuring safety of everyone and MIT's Class Notication and Support Team willÂ   
help that student continue learning to with the least possible disruption. If any of the Instructors inÂ   
this class are unable to attend in person due to covid-19, we will work together with the leadershipÂ   
of DUSP, the School, and the Institute to ensure minimum disruption.Â   
In the case of the need for any remote teaching, we will use this \\zoom classroom":Â   
â€¢ Meeting ID 994 1215 2841Â   
â€¢ Zoom link hereÂ   
â€¢ password: mitenergyÂ   
3.2 Anti-racist policiesÂ   
Impacts of energy, pollution, and climate change are profoundly unequally distributed on peopleÂ   
of color and/or the poor here and around the world. Throughout this class, I would like us toÂ   
work together in the best and most inclusive spirit of academic inquiry, including curiosity; free,Â   
responsible, and thoughtful expression; and tolerance and openness for dierent opinions. Let usÂ   
especially strive to change our own behaviors and habits that lead to racism and oppression.Â   
3.3 Land acknowledgementÂ   
MIT acknowledges Indigenous Peoples as the traditional stewards of the land, and the enduringÂ   
relationship that exists between them and their traditional territories. The land on which we sit isÂ   
the traditional unceded territory of the Wampanoag Nation. We acknowledge the painful historyÂ   
of genocide and forced occupation of their territory, and we honor and respect the many diverseÂ   
indigenous people connected to this land on which we gather from time immemorial.Â   
3.4 Inclusive classroomÂ   
MIT values an inclusive environment. I hope to foster a sense of community in this classroom andÂ   
consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals ofÂ   
all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religiousÂ   
and political aliations { and other visible and nonvisible dierences. All members of this classÂ   
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every otherÂ   
member of the class. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.Â   
3.5 Special accommodationsÂ   
MIT is committed to the principle of equal access. Students who need disability accommodationsÂ   
are encouraged to speak with Disability and Access Services (DAS), prior to or early in the semesterÂ   
so that accommodation requests can be evaluated and addressed in a timely fashion. If you have aÂ   
disability and are not planning to use accommodations, it is still recommended that you meet withÂ   
7Â   
DAS sta Â to familiarize yourself with their services and resources. Please visit the DAS website forÂ   
contact information. If you have already been approved for accommodations, class sta Â are readyÂ   
to assist with implementation. Please inform Professor Hsu and Madeleine Li who will overseeÂ   
accommodation implementation for this course.Â   
3.6 MIT student supportÂ   
3.6.1 Undergraduate studentsÂ   
You can reach Student Support Services (S3) here. If you are dealing with a personal or medicalÂ   
issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you shouldÂ   
contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verifyÂ   
your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor toÂ   
determine next steps. In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework withoutÂ   
verication from a dean. Please visit the S3 website for contact information and more ways thatÂ   
they can provide support.Â   
3.6.2 Graduate studentsÂ   
You can reach the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE) here. As a graduate student, a varietyÂ   
of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, andÂ   
interpersonal concerns. In the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation,Â   
coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and lifeÂ   
challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, completeÂ   
work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at [gradsupport@mit.edu](mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu) or viaÂ   
phone at (617) 253-4860.
