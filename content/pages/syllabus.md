2 Class  
2.1 Learning objectives  
• Learn about the role and potential of cities and users to shape the energy system,  
• Develop understanding of energy systems, infrastructure, and technology in cities,  
• Figure out how to achieve an equitable energy transition,  
• Develop ability to do simple back-of-the-envelope calculations,  
• Identify key points or issues for future management, intervention, or revolution,  
• Work together with a diverse group of people and disciplines, and  
• Develop a highly-detailed understanding for a group of cities together as a class.  
2.2 Introduction  
This class is about  guring out together what cities and users can do to reduce their energy use and  
carbon emissions. Many other classes at MIT focus on policies, technologies, and systems, often at  
the national or international level, but this course focuses on the scale of cities and users because:  
• cities are centers of economic activity, population, and energy and material consumption  
• cities, not nations, are making the most ambitious commitments towards climate goals,  
• this scale reveals inequality, racism, and environmental justice issues in the energy system,  
• the relationship of users to the energy system has been static for nearly a century,  
• new information and data technologies are rapidly changing the built environment,  
• developing countries could leapfrog existing technologies, and many developed countries need  
to replace existing systems.  
This course is designed for any students interested in learning how to intervene in the energy use  
of cities using policy, technology, economics, and urban planning. I welcome students with many  
dierent backgrounds because it enriches our discussions, but some of the following rationales for  
this course may also appeal to you:  
• For planners, there are many jobs in this area that will shape how we use energy in the future.  
This class will integrate fundamental technical understanding with your policy skills so you  
can tackle the inevitable energy and climate issues that will aect all communities in the  
future.  
• For engineers, 54% of all people now live in cities that generate 70% of world carbon emissions  
and 80% of world GDP; by 2050, 66% of the world's population is expected to be urban. The  
focus of this class on urban energy use, eciency, jurisdiction, institutions, and governance  
complements many other more technical classes at MIT.  
• For climate change: given the uncertain prospects of national and international eorts, eorts  
in cities may be the fastest and most pragmatic solution.  
2.3 Structure  
This class is divided into two halves:  
• in the  rst segment (September 9 to November 2) you are learning which basic calculations  
to perform in order to analyze one or two cities (more on that later), and we will learn about  
key technical aspects of energy systems in all cities.  
2  
• in the second segment (November 4 to December 9), we will examine the policies and institutions  
governing urban energy systems, with a particular focus on regulation and markets  
of the electricity sector in the US.  
Putting the two halves together will help you decide where and how to intervene in urban energy  
systems.  
2.4 Activities  
In the beginning of class, we will build a composite picture of our class, using our personal experiences  
and visions for the future to energy systems that you are familiar with. Please calculate  
the current carbon emissions for yourself and/or an average resident for where (a) you lived before  
MIT and (b) where and how you think you will live in 2050, using the CoolClimate calculator.  
In the  rst half of the semester, before each class, doing the reading and a basic calculation  
exercise will help build up your understanding of what numbers matter, as well as your background  
knowledge of a particular city. We will reinforce the knowledge with an exam, but if you do the  
calculation/homework each week, I expect that the exam should be fairly straightforward.  
In the second half of the semester, before each class, researching, writing up a few notes,  
submitting questions, and getting feedback will help you build up the base of knowledge and  
material that you need to write your paper. We will have group discussions in the last three classes  
to share knowledge from our papers. This is also a good chance to put  nishing touches on your  
nal paper. Writing a good paper is much easier if you plan ahead, get feedback or help from your  
classmates, the MIT Writing and Communication Center, and myself, and have time to revise.  
The  nal paper assignment will synthesize what you lean over the semester by considering the  
prospects for a technological or policy innovation in a city of your choosing (I recommend your  
home or future city). Undergraduates will be expected to write a short paper of 5 pages minimum.  
Graduate students will write a paper of 10 pages minimum, with the additional task of analyzing  
their chosen city in terms of its expected future demographic changes. See the paper writing  
guidelines below.  
2.5 Readings  
There are two books for the class. The  rst is required and the second is optional:  
1\. Required (free): MacKay, D.J., 2009. Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air, 1st ed.,  
UIT Cambridge Ltd. Available in paperback from your local or global bookseller for $27-50,  
and/or can be downloaded legally as a PDF or read in webpage format at withouthotair.com.  
The cheapest way to get a hardcopy is to print it out at CRON and have it bound at MIT  
Copytech.  
2\. Optional: Hawken, Paul, ed. 2017. Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed  
to Reverse Global Warming Penguin. Can be purchased at local bookstores or Amazon.  
Other papers assigned for each class and which will be available on the class folder on the cloud. I  
may occasionally modify the weekly readings and will notify you in advance.  
I will start most classroom days with a brief discussion about current events related to our  
reading, and this news service provides terric updates that will keep you updated on energy,  
climate, as well as related policies and legislation. You can also signup in advance for two news  
services:  
• E&E News, an excellent news service that you get free access to through the MIT Libraries  
here; select \\Join my organization's account".  
3  
• U.S. and regional Energy News Networks, available here. These newsletters are an excellent  
source of local and regional energy news.  
Other excellent climate newsletters are put out by the New York Times (Climate Fwd:); the New  
Yorker; the Atlantic; the Wall Street Journal; the Washington Post; Time; etc. It is all too much  
to read everyday but a valuable way to see what energy and climate people are talking about.  
2.6 Schedule & topics  
All readings can be found in the bibliography, class Google drive, and/or on the web. Readings are  
denoted by (links), with a dash to indicate chapter numbers and/or appendix letters. For example,  
\`\[1\]-2,3' indicates reading 1, chapters 2 and 3; s = skim; psets = problem sets; rq = send reading  
questions in for discussion on Slack.

2.7 Grading  
2.7.1 Expectations / norms  
• Do reading and submit your problem sets or questions evening before class  
• Ask questions and contribute insights for everyone's learning  
• Focus on class discussion and lecture  
• Use technology eectively and only as needed  
2.7.2 Breakdown  
The details marked TBD (to be determined) will depend on the number of students in the class  
and number of topics that we want to cover.  
Before class prep: problem sets and reading questions 25%  
Class presence / discussion / participation 10%  
Exam 25%  
Paper proposal 5%  
Short presentation, group discussion 5%  
Final paper 30%  
TOTAL = 100%  
Please make an eort to be on time for class, and please let me know in advance if you will miss  
class. Missing more than two classes will aect your participation / discussion grade.  
2.7.3 Assignments and due dates  
• Problem sets and reading questions are due by midnight (11:59 pm) the day before class.  
Earlier is better for your sleep, though.  
• Exam will follow a similar format as the problem sets. I may also give some additional practice  
problems.  
• Paper proposal: one-page single-spaced proposal maximum for your  nal paper (see below).  
The topic is not binding, but I want you to think about the topic and area early so you can  
look out for, and suggest to each other, material for your papers.  
• Short presentation: schedule TBD based on student interests (and numbers). One slide  
maximum, 16 point font minimum, must be circulated to your classmates and me in PDF  
format one full day beforehand.  
• Final paper: this will describe a strategic plan to meet one specic energy challenge for a  
specic city. This paper will include a description of your plan and/or intervention, with  
an assessment of its prospects for success (strengths, weaknesses, other contributing factors  
necessary), an assessment of the capability of proposed or existing institutions to carry out  
the plan, and an analysis of its likely environmental, economic, and social eects. You should  
also turn in basic calculations as needed (not included in the paper page limit), which shows  
how you derived the key calculations that are the foundation of your paper analysis. Due two  
days after last class, December 11.

2.7.4 Paper criteria  
In general, papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which they present a clear and coherent  
argument, introduce appropriate supporting evidence, and develop the argument to a logical  
conclusion. You should develop your writing and thoughts through multiple written drafts. Other  
considerations:  
• Format: Avoid overly fancy graphic layouts for your paper. Please use black text, white  
paper, 1.5 or double-spacing, a font with serifs, minimum font size 11.  
• Bibliographies: You should include a full bibliography in a common citation format (for  
example, University of Chicago, Harvard, MLA). This will not count towards the total pages  
of the paper. Zotero is a great free tool that can help you organize your citations, materials,  
and writing process.  
• Tables & graphics: You are encouraged to use any tools that you need to communicate, such  
as maps,  gures, or tables, but these exhibits may not exceed 20% of the pages. Captions and  
references help to integrate graphics and text. These exhibits will also be graded for clarity,  
cogency, and the degree to which they support, inform, or extend the argument presented in  
the text.  
• The MIT Writing and Communication Center (WCC) oers free one-on-one professional advice  
from communication experts with advanced degrees and publishing experience. The  
WCC can help you further develop your oral communication skills and learn about all types  
of academic and professional writing. You can learn more about the WCC consultations at  
http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center and register with the online scheduler  
to make appointments through https://mit.mywconline.com. Please note that the WCC  
hours are oered on Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m., and  ll up fast.  
2.7.5 Extensions  
Each person is allowed to miss up to 3 psets and reading questions, which are assessed automatically  
if you miss the midnight deadline. I can't give any extensions for the  nal paper because grades  
are due three days after the end of class, so plan ahead for this. In cases of extreme physical or  
emotional circumstances, any further extensions should be requested from the Oce of the Dean of  
Graduate Education (http://odge.mit.edu); if they decide that an extension is warranted, they  
will then send me a generic note, which preserves your privacy.  
2.7.6 ADA accommodations  
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet course  
requirements should contact me as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements with MIT's  
Student Disabilities Services: http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html.  
2.7.7 Academic integrity  
Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, and facilitating academic dishonesty are academic  
crimes. It is your responsibility as students and scholars to understand the denition of any such  
activities, and to avoid and discourage them. Engaging in these activities either knowingly or  
unknowingly may result in severe academic sanctions, and you are therefore expected to familiarize  
yourself with MIT's policies: https://integrity.mit.edu.

3 DUSP policies & resources  
3.1 COVID contingency plans  
MIT and DUSP are excited at the opportunity for a return to in-person teaching and learning after  
2+ semesters of remote life. To ensure that all classes can and will be delivered in person, MIT  
has worked hard to put into place policies, procedures and technologies to maximize the likelihood  
of a safe and uninterrupted semester. That said, the ever-evolving pandemic means we need to  
be prepared. If any student in class tests positive for covid-19, MIT Medical has established clear  
procedures for ensuring safety of everyone and MIT's Class Notication and Support Team will  
help that student continue learning to with the least possible disruption. If any of the Instructors in  
this class are unable to attend in person due to covid-19, we will work together with the leadership  
of DUSP, the School, and the Institute to ensure minimum disruption.  
In the case of the need for any remote teaching, we will use this \\zoom classroom":  
• Meeting ID 994 1215 2841  
• Zoom link here  
• password: mitenergy  
3.2 Anti-racist policies  
Impacts of energy, pollution, and climate change are profoundly unequally distributed on people  
of color and/or the poor here and around the world. Throughout this class, I would like us to  
work together in the best and most inclusive spirit of academic inquiry, including curiosity; free,  
responsible, and thoughtful expression; and tolerance and openness for dierent opinions. Let us  
especially strive to change our own behaviors and habits that lead to racism and oppression.  
3.3 Land acknowledgement  
MIT acknowledges Indigenous Peoples as the traditional stewards of the land, and the enduring  
relationship that exists between them and their traditional territories. The land on which we sit is  
the traditional unceded territory of the Wampanoag Nation. We acknowledge the painful history  
of genocide and forced occupation of their territory, and we honor and respect the many diverse  
indigenous people connected to this land on which we gather from time immemorial.  
3.4 Inclusive classroom  
MIT values an inclusive environment. I hope to foster a sense of community in this classroom and  
consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals of  
all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious  
and political aliations { and other visible and nonvisible dierences. All members of this class  
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other  
member of the class. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.  
3.5 Special accommodations  
MIT is committed to the principle of equal access. Students who need disability accommodations  
are encouraged to speak with Disability and Access Services (DAS), prior to or early in the semester  
so that accommodation requests can be evaluated and addressed in a timely fashion. If you have a  
disability and are not planning to use accommodations, it is still recommended that you meet with  
7  
DAS sta  to familiarize yourself with their services and resources. Please visit the DAS website for  
contact information. If you have already been approved for accommodations, class sta  are ready  
to assist with implementation. Please inform Professor Hsu and Madeleine Li who will oversee  
accommodation implementation for this course.  
3.6 MIT student support  
3.6.1 Undergraduate students  
You can reach Student Support Services (S3) here. If you are dealing with a personal or medical  
issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should  
contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify  
your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to  
determine next steps. In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without  
verication from a dean. Please visit the S3 website for contact information and more ways that  
they can provide support.  
3.6.2 Graduate students  
You can reach the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE) here. As a graduate student, a variety  
of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and  
interpersonal concerns. In the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation,  
coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life  
challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete  
work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at gradsupport@mit.edu or via  
phone at (617) 253-4860.
