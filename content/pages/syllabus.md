## Course Description

This class is about figuring out together what cities and users can do to reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. Many other classes at MIT focus on policies, technologies, and systems, often at the national or international level, but this course focuses on the scale of cities and users for the following reasons:

- Cities are centers of economic activity, population, and energy and material consumption.
- Cities, not nations, are making the most ambitious commitments towards climate goals.
- This scale reveals inequality, racism, and environmental justice issues in the energy system.
- The relationship of users to the energy system has been static for nearly a century.
- New information and data technologies are rapidly changing the built environment.
- Developing countries could leapfrog existing technologies, and many developed countries need to replace existing systems. 

This course is designed for any students interested in learning how to intervene in the energy use of cities using policy, technology, economics, and urban planning. I welcome students with many different backgrounds because it enriches our discussions, but some of the following rationales for this course may also appeal to you:  

- For planners, there are many jobs in this area that will shape how we use energy in the future. This class will integrate fundamental technical understanding with your policy skills so you can tackle the inevitable energy and climate issues that will affect all communities in the future.  
- For engineers, 54% of all people now live in cities that generate 70% of world carbon emissions and 80% of world GDP; by 2050, 66% of the world's population is expected to be urban. The focus of this class on urban energy use, efficiency, jurisdiction, institutions, and governance complements many other more technical classes at MIT.
- For climate change: given the uncertain prospects of national and international efforts, efforts in cities may be the fastest and most pragmatic solution.

## Expectations in COVID  

For everyone, and most definitely in order of importance:  

1. Stay healthy (e.g. sleep, eat, practice self-care, esp. mental!)  
2. Keep each other healthy (e.g. wear masks, practice pre-emptive isolation)  
3. Participate (come to class, office hours; ask questions, engage on Slack ) 
4. Communicate (talk about how things are going with me or others)  
5. Stay flexible (Everybody continue to do their best!)  

Any ideas or suggestions that you have to improve your and our experience are welcome!

## Learning objectives 

- Learn about the role and potential of cities and users to shape the energy system
- Develop understanding of energy systems, infrastructure, and technology in cities
- Figure out how to achieve an equitable energy transition
- Develop ability to do simple back-of-the-envelope calculations
- Identify key points or issues for future management, intervention, or revolution
- Work together with a diverse group of people and disciplines
- Develop a highly-detailed understanding for a group of cities together as a class

## Structure of the Course

This class is divided into two halves. In the first segment you are learning which basic calculations to perform in order to analyze one or two cities (more on that later), and we will learn about key technical aspects of energy systems in all cities. In the second segment we will examine the policies and institutions governing urban energy systems, with a particular focus on regulation and markets of the electricity sector in the US. Putting the two halves together will help you decide where and how to intervene in urban energy systems.  

## Activities 

In the beginning of class, we will build a composite picture of our class, using our personal experiences and visions for the future to energy systems that you are familiar with. Please calculate the current carbon emissions for yourself and/or an average resident for where (a) you lived before MIT and (b) where and how you think you will live in 2050, using the CoolClimate calculator. In the first half of the semester, before each class, doing the reading and a basic calculation exercise will help build up your understanding of what numbers matter, as well as your background knowledge of a particular city. We will reinforce the knowledge with an exam, but if you do the calculation/homework each week, I expect that the exam should be fairly straightforward. In the second half of the semester, before each class, researching, writing up a few notes, submitting questions, and getting feedback will help you build up the base of knowledge and material that you need to write your paper. We will have group discussions in the last three classes to share knowledge from our papers. This is also a good chance to put finishing touches on your final paper. Writing a good paper is much easier if you plan ahead, get feedback or help from your classmates, the MIT Writing and Communication Center, and myself, and have time to revise.

The final paper assignment will synthesize what you lean over the semester by considering the prospects for a technological or policy innovation in a city of your choosing (I recommend your home or future city). Undergraduates will be expected to write a short paper of 5 pages minimum. Graduate students will write a paper of 10 pages minimum, with the additional task of analyzing their chosen city in terms of its expected future demographic changes. See the paper writing guidelines below.  

## Readings

There are two books for the class. The first is required and the second is optional: 

- Required (free): MacKay, D.J., 2009. *Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air*, 1st ed.. UIT Cambridge Ltd. Available in paperback from your local or global bookseller for $27-50, and/or can be downloaded legally as a PDF or read in webpage format at [withouthotair.com](withouthotair.com). 
- Optional: Hawken, Paul, ed. 2017. *Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming.* Penguin.

Other papers assigned for each class and which will be available on the class folder on the cloud. I may occasionally modify the weekly readings and will notify you in advance.

I will start most classroom days with a brief discussion about current events related to our reading, and this news service provides terrific updates that will keep you updated on energy, climate, as well as related policies and legislation. You can also sign up in advance for two news services:  

- E&E News, an excellent news service that you get free access to through the MIT Libraries    
    here; select \\Join my organization's account".  
- U.S. and regional Energy News Networks, available here. These newsletters are an excellent    
    source of local and regional energy news.  

Other excellent climate newsletters are put out by the *New York Times* (Climate Forward), the *New Yorker,* the *Atlantic,* the *Wall Street Journal,* the *Washington Post,* *Time,* etc. It is all too much to read every day, but a valuable way to see what energy and climate people are talking about.

**Schedule & topics**   
All readings can be found in the bibliography, class Google drive, and/or on the web. Readings are    
denoted by (links), with a dash to indicate chapter numbers and/or appendix letters. For example,    
\`\[1\]-2,3' indicates reading 1, chapters 2 and 3; s = skim; psets = problem sets; rq = send reading    
questions in for discussion on Slack.

TOTAL = 100%    
Please make an eort to be on time for class, and please let me know in advance if you will miss    
class. Missing more than two classes will aect your participation / discussion grade.    
2.7.3 Assignments and due dates    
• Problem sets and reading questions are due by midnight (11:59 pm) the day before class.    
Earlier is better for your sleep, though.    
• Exam will follow a similar format as the problem sets. I may also give some additional practice    
problems.    
• Paper proposal: one-page single-spaced proposal maximum for your  nal paper (see below).    
The topic is not binding, but I want you to think about the topic and area early so you can    
look out for, and suggest to each other, material for your papers.    
• Short presentation: schedule TBD based on student interests (and numbers). One slide    
maximum, 16 point font minimum, must be circulated to your classmates and me in PDF    
format one full day beforehand.    
• Final paper: this will describe a strategic plan to meet one specic energy challenge for a    
specic city. This paper will include a description of your plan and/or intervention, with    
an assessment of its prospects for success (strengths, weaknesses, other contributing factors    
necessary), an assessment of the capability of proposed or existing institutions to carry out    
the plan, and an analysis of its likely environmental, economic, and social eects. You should    
also turn in basic calculations as needed (not included in the paper page limit), which shows    
how you derived the key calculations that are the foundation of your paper analysis. Due two    
days after last class, December 11.

**2.7.4 Paper criteria**   
In general, papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which they present a clear and coherent    
argument, introduce appropriate supporting evidence, and develop the argument to a logical    
conclusion. You should develop your writing and thoughts through multiple written drafts. Other    
considerations:    
• Format: Avoid overly fancy graphic layouts for your paper. Please use black text, white    
paper, 1.5 or double-spacing, a font with serifs, minimum font size 11.    
• Bibliographies: You should include a full bibliography in a common citation format (for    
example, University of Chicago, Harvard, MLA). This will not count towards the total pages    
of the paper. Zotero is a great free tool that can help you organize your citations, materials,    
and writing process.    
• Tables & graphics: You are encouraged to use any tools that you need to communicate, such    
as maps,  gures, or tables, but these exhibits may not exceed 20% of the pages. Captions and    
references help to integrate graphics and text. These exhibits will also be graded for clarity,    
cogency, and the degree to which they support, inform, or extend the argument presented in    
the text.    
• The MIT Writing and Communication Center (WCC) oers free one-on-one professional advice    
from communication experts with advanced degrees and publishing experience. The    
WCC can help you further develop your oral communication skills and learn about all types    
of academic and professional writing. You can learn more about the WCC consultations at    
[http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center) and register with the online scheduler    
to make appointments through [https://mit.mywconline.com](https://mit.mywconline.com). Please note that the WCC    
hours are oered on Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m., and  ll up fast.    
2.7.5 Extensions    
Each person is allowed to miss up to 3 psets and reading questions, which are assessed automatically    
if you miss the midnight deadline. I can't give any extensions for the  nal paper because grades    
are due three days after the end of class, so plan ahead for this. In cases of extreme physical or    
emotional circumstances, any further extensions should be requested from the Oce of the Dean of    
Graduate Education ([http://odge.mit.edu);](http://odge.mit.edu);) if they decide that an extension is warranted, they    
will then send me a generic note, which preserves your privacy.    
2.7.6 ADA accommodations    
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet course    
requirements should contact me as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements with MIT's    
Student Disabilities Services: [http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html](http://web.mit.edu/uaap/sds/index.html).    
2.7.7 Academic integrity    
Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, and facilitating academic dishonesty are academic    
crimes. It is your responsibility as students and scholars to understand the denition of any such    
activities, and to avoid and discourage them. Engaging in these activities either knowingly or    
unknowingly may result in severe academic sanctions, and you are therefore expected to familiarize    
yourself with MIT's policies: [https://integrity.mit.edu](https://integrity.mit.edu).

3 **DUSP policies & resources**   
3.1 COVID contingency plans    
MIT and DUSP are excited at the opportunity for a return to in-person teaching and learning after    
2+ semesters of remote life. To ensure that all classes can and will be delivered in person, MIT    
has worked hard to put into place policies, procedures and technologies to maximize the likelihood    
of a safe and uninterrupted semester. That said, the ever-evolving pandemic means we need to    
be prepared. If any student in class tests positive for covid-19, MIT Medical has established clear    
procedures for ensuring safety of everyone and MIT's Class Notication and Support Team will    
help that student continue learning to with the least possible disruption. If any of the Instructors in    
this class are unable to attend in person due to covid-19, we will work together with the leadership    
of DUSP, the School, and the Institute to ensure minimum disruption.    
In the case of the need for any remote teaching, we will use this \\zoom classroom":    
• Meeting ID 994 1215 2841    
• Zoom link here    
• password: mitenergy    
3.2 Anti-racist policies    
Impacts of energy, pollution, and climate change are profoundly unequally distributed on people    
of color and/or the poor here and around the world. Throughout this class, I would like us to    
work together in the best and most inclusive spirit of academic inquiry, including curiosity; free,    
responsible, and thoughtful expression; and tolerance and openness for dierent opinions. Let us    
especially strive to change our own behaviors and habits that lead to racism and oppression.    
3.3 Land acknowledgement    
MIT acknowledges Indigenous Peoples as the traditional stewards of the land, and the enduring    
relationship that exists between them and their traditional territories. The land on which we sit is    
the traditional unceded territory of the Wampanoag Nation. We acknowledge the painful history    
of genocide and forced occupation of their territory, and we honor and respect the many diverse    
indigenous people connected to this land on which we gather from time immemorial.    
3.4 Inclusive classroom    
MIT values an inclusive environment. I hope to foster a sense of community in this classroom and    
consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals of    
all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious    
and political aliations { and other visible and nonvisible dierences. All members of this class    
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other    
member of the class. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.    
3.5 Special accommodations    
MIT is committed to the principle of equal access. Students who need disability accommodations    
are encouraged to speak with Disability and Access Services (DAS), prior to or early in the semester    
so that accommodation requests can be evaluated and addressed in a timely fashion. If you have a    
disability and are not planning to use accommodations, it is still recommended that you meet with    
7    
DAS sta  to familiarize yourself with their services and resources. Please visit the DAS website for    
contact information. If you have already been approved for accommodations, class sta  are ready    
to assist with implementation. Please inform Professor Hsu and Madeleine Li who will oversee    
accommodation implementation for this course.    
3.6 MIT student support    
3.6.1 Undergraduate students    
You can reach Student Support Services (S3) here. If you are dealing with a personal or medical    
issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should    
contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify    
your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to    
determine next steps. In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without    
verication from a dean. Please visit the S3 website for contact information and more ways that    
they can provide support.    
3.6.2 Graduate students    
You can reach the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE) here. As a graduate student, a variety    
of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and    
interpersonal concerns. In the Oce of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation,    
coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life    
challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete    
work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at [gradsupport@mit.edu](mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu) or via    
phone at (617) 253-4860.
