2.7.3 Assignments and due dates  
• Problem sets and reading questions are due by midnight (11:59 pm) the day before class.  
Earlier is better for your sleep, though.  
• Exam will follow a similar format as the problem sets. I may also give some additional practice  
problems.  
• Paper proposal: one-page single-spaced proposal maximum for your  nal paper (see below).  
The topic is not binding, but I want you to think about the topic and area early so you can  
look out for, and suggest to each other, material for your papers.  
• Short presentation: schedule TBD based on student interests (and numbers). One slide  
maximum, 16 point font minimum, must be circulated to your classmates and me in PDF  
format one full day beforehand.  
• Final paper: this will describe a strategic plan to meet one specic energy challenge for a  
specic city. This paper will include a description of your plan and/or intervention, with  
an assessment of its prospects for success (strengths, weaknesses, other contributing factors  
necessary), an assessment of the capability of proposed or existing institutions to carry out  
the plan, and an analysis of its likely environmental, economic, and social eects. You should  
also turn in basic calculations as needed (not included in the paper page limit), which shows  
how you derived the key calculations that are the foundation of your paper analysis. Due two  
days after last class, December 11.

2.7.4 Paper criteria  
In general, papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which they present a clear and coherent  
argument, introduce appropriate supporting evidence, and develop the argument to a logical  
conclusion. You should develop your writing and thoughts through multiple written drafts. Other  
considerations:  
• Format: Avoid overly fancy graphic layouts for your paper. Please use black text, white  
paper, 1.5 or double-spacing, a font with serifs, minimum font size 11.  
• Bibliographies: You should include a full bibliography in a common citation format (for  
example, University of Chicago, Harvard, MLA). This will not count towards the total pages  
of the paper. Zotero is a great free tool that can help you organize your citations, materials,  
and writing process.  
• Tables & graphics: You are encouraged to use any tools that you need to communicate, such  
as maps,  gures, or tables, but these exhibits may not exceed 20% of the pages. Captions and  
references help to integrate graphics and text. These exhibits will also be graded for clarity,  
cogency, and the degree to which they support, inform, or extend the argument presented in  
the text.  
• The MIT Writing and Communication Center (WCC) oers free one-on-one professional advice  
from communication experts with advanced degrees and publishing experience. The  
WCC can help you further develop your oral communication skills and learn about all types  
of academic and professional writing. You can learn more about the WCC consultations at  
http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center and register with the online scheduler  
to make appointments through https://mit.mywconline.com. Please note that the WCC  
hours are oered on Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m., and  ll up fast.
